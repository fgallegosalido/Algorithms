# Project Euler
Solutions to the **Project Euler** competition.

## Information
In this folder you can find all the solutions to the problems that I've been able to solve until now. At the moment, they're written either in C++14 (most of them) or Python 3 (the ones I really needed arbitrary precision).

This solutions are here so other people can compare its solutions with mine and learn something new, or help people to get ideas for their solutions and look for s****d errors.

Every file comes with a header with the problem number, name, link to the problem, "difficulty" (some problems are marked as easy and they really are not) and language that is used to program the solution.

## ¡¡Important!!
Even though this solutions will make you pass all the test cases, I can't ensure you that they're the best solutions, follow a good methodology or even if they have the best idea in the background. They're written just to pass the test cases, so comments are really lacking (I don't expect you to understand the code).

Also, I **really**, **really** encourage you to try to solve the problems yourself. In fact, copying this solutions would be cheating and you don't really learn anything by doing it.
