# Algorithms

This repository contains some algorithms I've implemented and I will add more during time.

Note that I'm using the chrono library to check time execution, so every file must be compiled with C++11. I also recommend compiling with some optimization, like -O2. To compile, just enter in the terminal:
``` bash
$> g++ -O2 -std=c++11 <source_file> -o <program_name>
```

Every program should come with little help to use it.
